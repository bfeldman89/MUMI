# MUMI

a repo for creating, revising and sharing the transcripts of MUMI panels and keynotes

## contributing

All of the audio was initially transcribed via Otter.ai, but they aren't perfect, and I'm open sourcing them for revisions. I have created a group at https://otter.ai/group/209548. It's much easier to revise transcripts in Otter than manually editing a text file while listening to an audio file. Here's a gif of me editing one of the transcripts ðŸ‘‡

Here's [a link](https://otter.ai/s/pKB784gfT2uanGvMZwA96g?t=165s) to see what the transcript of the third MUMI video currently looks like on otter.ai. Obviously, once the revisions are complete, the text will be exported into a plain text, html, pdf, etc. files.

**If you'd like to help revise the automated transcripts, please create a free Otter account using [this referral link](https://otter.ai/referrals/O3X255WV) and let me know via [email](mailto:bfeldman89@pm.me) or [DM](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=2163941252).** Include the email account you used to create your Otter account, so that I can invite you to the [group](https://otter.ai/group/209548), which automatically gives you editing permission for the files.
