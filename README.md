# MUMI

This is a reo for creating, revising and sharing the transcripts of MUMI panels and keynotes. 

## roadmap

- [x] download [videos from facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pg/MUMIConference/videos/)
- [x] export audio to reduce size
- [x] upload to Otter
- [x] create Otter [group](https://otter.ai/group/209548)
- [x] open source revision process
- [ ] share final transcripts

## contributing

All of the audio was initially transcribed via Otter.ai, but they aren't perfect, and I'm open sourcing them for revisions. I have created a group at https://otter.ai/group/209548. It's much easier to revise transcripts in Otter than manually editing a text file while listening to an audio file.

**If you'd like to help revise the automated transcripts, please create a free Otter account using [this referral link](https://otter.ai/referrals/O3X255WV) and let me know via [email](mailto:bfeldman89@pm.me) or [DM](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=2163941252).** Include the email account you used to create your Otter account, so that I can invite you to the [group](https://otter.ai/group/209548), which automatically gives you editing permission for the files.

## disclaimers

This repo is not maintained by the MUMI organizers, and they aren't responsible for its contents. As stated above, the raw transcripts are created by AI, and they are not 100% accurate. The revised transcripts will be as close to 100% accurate as possible/practical.
